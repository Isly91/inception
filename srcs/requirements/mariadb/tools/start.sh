# This script is used to initialize a MariaDB database container.
# It sets up the database and user credentials using secrets stored in Docker secrets.
# It also starts the MariaDB service and creates a database and user with the specified privileges.
# The script expects the following environment variables to be set:
# - DB_NAME: The name of the database to be created.
# - DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: The root password for the MariaDB server.
# - DB_PASSWORD: The password for the user to be created.
# - DB_CREDENTIALS: The username for the user to be created.
# The script also expects the following secrets to be available in the Docker secrets directory:
# - db_root_password: The root password for the MariaDB server.
# - db_password: The password for the user to be created.
# - credentials: The username for the user to be created.
# The script starts the MariaDB service, waits for it to be ready, and then creates the database and user with the specified privileges.
# It also stops the MariaDB service before executing the command passed to the script.

# It prevents unnecessary background processes.
# It allows command overriding when running the container.
